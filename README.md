   - Install Android Studio for managing SDKs and emulators.
   - Make sure to install the Flutter and Dart plugins.

3. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Install JDK 11 or JDK 17. Ensure itâ€™s correctly configured in your system's environment variables.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patangation/actividades_android.git

## Running the App

1. **Set Up an Emulator or Connect a Device**

   - **Emulator:** Open Android Studio and create an AVD (Android Virtual Device) from `Tools > Device Manager`.
   - **Physical Device:** Connect your Android device via USB and ensure USB debugging is enabled.

2. **Run the App**

   Use the following command to run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use Android Studio:
   - Open the project in Android Studio.
   - Select the target device or emulator from the device dropdown.
   - Click the green play button to run the app.

## Troubleshooting

- **SDK Location Issues:** Ensure the Android SDK is installed and correctly configured in Android Studio (`File > Project Structure > SDK Location`).
